# Data

For this project, I used this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Full credit for the data goes to Nik Davis.

Unzip `steam.zip` to `tgdne/data/steam/`. Run `tgdne/scripts/download_images.py` with the path to the appropriate dataset and path to images destination. Ex: `$ python scripts/download_images.py data/datasetv2.csv data/steam_header_images/`.
